# Game Design Document

## Core Concept
AI-Evolving RPG is a narrative-driven role-playing game that evolves both visually and mechanically throughout the player's journey. Starting as a pixel-art traditional RPG, the game gradually transforms into a high-fidelity, AI-driven experience, mirroring the evolution of gaming technology itself.

## Setting
The game takes place across two interconnected realms:

1. **Physical World (Sci-Fi Setting)**: A futuristic world where technology and nature coexist, featuring space stations, alien planets, and cyberpunk cities.

2. **AI Network (Digital Setting)**: An abstract digital landscape representing the inner workings of a vast artificial intelligence, with environments that defy physical laws and visualize data in surreal ways.

## Evolution Stages
The game progresses through distinct visual and mechanical evolution stages:

### Stage 1: Pixel Genesis
- **Visual Style**: 16-bit pixel art
- **Gameplay**: Traditional turn-based combat
- **World Structure**: Grid-based movement, fixed camera

### Stage 2: Early 3D
- **Visual Style**: Low-poly 3D models with pixel textures
- **Gameplay**: ATB (Active Time Battle) system
- **World Structure**: Free movement, controllable camera

### Stage 3: Modern Fidelity
- **Visual Style**: Modern 3D graphics
- **Gameplay**: Real-time combat with tactical pausing
- **World Structure**: Open world with dynamic events

### Stage 4: AI Enhanced
- **Visual Style**: High-fidelity rendering with procedural elements
- **Gameplay**: Context-aware AI systems that adapt to player style
- **World Structure**: Procedurally generated content that responds to player choices

## Core Gameplay Loop
1. **Exploration**: Discover new areas across both the physical and digital realms
2. **Character Development**: Customize abilities, appearance, and skills
3. **Narrative Choices**: Make decisions that shape the story and world
4. **Combat Challenges**: Engage in strategic battles that evolve in complexity
5. **Evolution Triggers**: Reach milestones that advance the game to the next evolution stage

## Character System
Players create a protagonist who exists in both the physical and digital worlds:

- **Physical Form**: Traditional RPG attributes (Strength, Dexterity, etc.)
- **Digital Form**: Information-based attributes (Processing, Encryption, etc.)
- **Job System**: Characters can switch between specialized roles that unlock different abilities
- **Evolution**: As the game evolves, characters gain new customization options and abilities

## Narrative Structure
The story follows a protagonist discovering their connection to both the physical and digital realms. Key narrative elements include:

- **Meta-Narrative**: The evolution of the game itself is integrated into the story
- **Branching Paths**: Player choices create meaningful narrative divergence
- **Emergent Storytelling**: AI-driven systems create unique narrative moments based on player actions
- **Multi-Ending Design**: The game concludes differently based on cumulative player choices

## Planned Features
- Dynamic weather and environmental systems
- Relationship system with NPCs that evolve over time
- Procedurally generated side quests
- Mini-games that change based on evolution stage
- Cross-realm puzzles requiring interaction between physical and digital worlds

## Art Direction Guidelines
- Clear visual distinction between evolution stages
- Consistent color palette that evolves but maintains recognizable themes
- Character designs that maintain recognizable silhouettes across evolution stages
- UI that transforms along with the game's visual style
