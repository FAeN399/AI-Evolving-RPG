# Technical Plan

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Primary programming language
- **Three.js**: Initial 3D rendering engine
- **Custom WebGL Engine**: Future replacement for Three.js (planned for Stage 3)
- **Howler.js**: Audio management
- **LocalForage**: Client-side storage for save data
- **Webpack**: Module bundling and build pipeline

### Optional Frontend Framework Considerations
- **React**: For UI components and state management
- **PixiJS**: Alternative for 2D UI rendering directly in WebGL

## Architecture Overview

### Engine Abstraction Layer
We will implement a rendering abstraction layer that will initially use Three.js but can later be replaced with a custom WebGL engine. This will:

- Encapsulate all Three.js-specific code
- Provide a stable API for the rest of the application
- Allow for gradual migration to custom WebGL in later stages

```
Application Logic → Engine Abstraction Layer → Rendering Engine (Three.js → Custom WebGL)
```

### Entity Component System (ECS)
We'll implement a lightweight ECS architecture to manage game objects and behaviors:

- **Entities**: Base objects in the game world
- **Components**: Reusable modules that add functionality to entities
- **Systems**: Logic that operates on entities with specific component combinations

### State Management
Game state will be managed through:

- A central state store for global game state
- Component-local state for entity-specific data
- Scene-specific state managers for transitional elements

### Evolution System Architecture
Each evolution stage will have:
- A dedicated renderer configuration
- Stage-specific assets and shaders
- Transition systems for smooth evolution between stages

## Performance Strategies

### Asset Loading
- Progressive asset loading based on player location
- Preloading assets for upcoming areas during gameplay
- Version-specific assets loaded only when needed (evolution stages)

### Rendering Optimization
- Level-of-detail (LOD) systems for complex models
- Frustum culling for off-screen objects
- Instancing for repeated elements
- Custom shaders for specific visual effects

### Memory Management
- Asset unloading for unused resources
- Texture atlasing for sprite-based elements
- Object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects

## Migration Strategy (Three.js to Custom WebGL)

### Phase 1: Abstraction
- Complete engine abstraction layer
- Document all Three.js usage patterns

### Phase 2: Replacement Research
- Evaluate TWGL.js, GLMatrix, and other WebGL utilities
- Build proof-of-concept renderers for key visual elements

### Phase 3: Incremental Replacement
- Replace rendering components one by one
- Maintain compatibility with existing game systems

### Phase 4: Optimization
- Implement custom shaders for game-specific needs
- Add advanced rendering features

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core systems and algorithms
- Integration tests for scene transitions and evolution stages
- Performance benchmarking suite
- Visual regression testing for rendering consistency

## Deployment Pipeline
- Development builds with source maps and debug tools
- Staging environment for testing
- Production builds with optimized assets
- Automated deployment to web hosting

## Tools Integration
- Level editor for world design
- AI simulation tools for testing procedural systems
- UI editor for interface design and testing
